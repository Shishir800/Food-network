                micronutrients, and
                adequate food energy. A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include
                little to no processed food or sweetened beverages.</p>

                substances.

                85% of daily energy use is from fat and carbohydrates and 15% from protein. In humans, nutrition is
                mainly achieved through the process of putting foods into our mouths, chewing and swallowing it. The
                required amounts of the essential nutrients differ by age and the state of the body.So here i am as your
                diet consultant</p>

            <p id="diet-par">A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many
                chronic
                noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and
                consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for
                healthy
                diet</p>
